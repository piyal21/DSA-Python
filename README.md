## About

The goal of this repo is to provide clear and efficient Python implementations of common data structures and algorithms. These can be used for educational purposes, interview preparation, or as a reference for solving coding problems.

## Data Structures

- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly)
- Stacks
- Queues (Simple, Circular, Priority)
- Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree)
- Graphs (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)
- Hash Tables
- Heaps (Min Heap, Max Heap)

Each data structure has its own Python file with implementation and example usage.

## Algorithms

- Sorting: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort
- Searching: Linear Search, Binary Search
- Graph Algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford
- Dynamic Programming: Fibonacci, Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence
- Greedy Algorithms: Fractional Knapsack, Huffman Coding
- Backtracking: N-Queens, Sudoku Solver

Algorithms are implemented in separate Python files with test cases.
